# STREET RACER — SALARX RACING

A polished, lightweight arcade street-racing game built for phones, tablets and desktop browsers.

## What changed

STREET RACER now uses a canvas-based racing renderer instead of emoji cars and a basic DOM road. The game has a complete progression loop, responsive controls, dynamic environments and a refreshed premium UI while keeping the project dependency-free.

## Features

- Cinematic STREET RACER / SALARX RACING menu
- Canvas-rendered cars, traffic, road, scenery, lighting and effects
- 7 cars: Starter, Street GT, Supercar, Hypercar, Muscle, JDM and Track Car

- Shop for cars and visual items

- Missions with coin and XP rewards
- Player levels, XP, coins, best score and best distance
- LocalStorage progression that survives refreshes
- Lightweight Web Audio button/engine-style feedback
- Sound and performance settings
- Responsive phone/tablet/desktop layout
- PWA install support with versioned offline caching
- No external libraries or large asset downloads

## Controls

### Desktop
- Arrow Left / A — steer left
- Arrow Right / D — steer right
- Arrow Down / S — brake
- Space / N — nitro

### Mobile
Use the four large on-screen buttons for left, right, brake and nitro.

## PWA

The manifest is configured for standalone installation and includes local icons. The service worker uses a versioned cache and removes older SALARX caches when a new version activates, reducing stale Street Racer / SALAR OS builds.

## Files

- `index.html` — complete game, renderer, UI and progression
- `manifest.json` — PWA metadata and icons
- `sw.js` — offline caching and cache migration
- `icon-192.svg` — install icon
- `icon-512.svg` — install icon

## Run

Open the GitHub Pages site in a modern browser, or serve the repository from a local web server. PWA installation and service-worker features require HTTPS (GitHub Pages qualifies).

## Branding

**STREET RACER**  
**SALARX RACING**

The old **SALAR OS** branding is not used by the game.
